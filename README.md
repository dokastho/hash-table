# hash-table
The purpose of this file is to demonstrate my understanding of the c++ STL unordered_map. This will include the following collision resolution methods: seperate chaining, quadratic probing and double hashing. These three methods are fundementally different in concept, and are therefore included in this snapshot. Not included is linear probing due to itâ€™s similarity and inferiority to quadratic probing.

This snapshot also demonstrates an implementation of templates and polymorphism
